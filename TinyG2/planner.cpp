/* --- Planner Notes ----
 *
 *	The planner works below the canonical machine and above the motor mapping and stepper
 *	execution layers. A rudimentary multitasking capability is implemented for long-running
 *	commands such as lines, arcs, and dwells. These functions are coded as non-blocking
 *	continuations - which are simple state machines that are re-entered multiple times
 *	until a particular operation is complete. These functions have 2 parts - the initial call,
 *	which sets up the local context (closure), and callbacks (continuations) that are called
 *  from the main loop (in controller.c). These tasks only support a single instantiation
 *  and are therefore also not re-entrant - as they rely on singletons for closure.
 *
 *	One important concept is isolation of state at the three layers of the data model -
 *  the Gcode model (gm), motion planner model (bf queue & mm), and motion runtime model (mr).
 *  These are designated as "model", "planner" and "runtime" in function names.
 *
 *	The Gcode model is owned by the canonical machine and should only be accessed by cm_xxxx()
 *	functions. Data from the Gcode model is transferred to the motion planner by the mp_xxx()
 *	functions called by the canonical machine.
 *
 *	The planner should only use data in the planner model. When a move (block) is ready for
 *	execution the relevant data from the planner is transferred to the runtime model,
 *  which should also be isolated.
 *
 *	Models at different levels should never use data from other levels as the data may have
 *	changed or be out-of-sync and lead to unpredictable results.

 *	 - mr.target	- target position of runtime segment

 * mp_queue_command() - queue a synchronous Mcode, program control, or other command

 *
 *  How this works:
 *    - The command is called by the Gcode interpreter (cm_<command>, e.g. an M code)
 *    - cm_ function calls mp_queue_command which puts it in the planning queue (bf buffer).
 *      This involves setting some parameters and registering a callback to the
 *      execution function in the canonical machine.
 *    - the planning queue gets to the function and calls _exec_command()
 *    - ...which puts a pointer to the bf buffer in the prep struct (st_pre)
 *    - When the runtime gets to the end of the current activity (sending steps, counting a dwell)
 *      if executes mp_runtime_command...
 *    - ...which uses the callback function in the bf and the saved parameters in the vectors
 *    - To finish up mp_runtime_command() needs to free the bf buffer
 *
 *  Doing it this way instead of synchronizing on an empty queue simplifies the
 *  handling of feedholds, feed overrides, buffer flushes, and thread blocking,
 *  and makes keeping the queue full much easier - therefore avoiding Q starvation

/*
 * mp_plan_buffer()
 *
 *  mp_plan_buffer()'s job is to invoke planning intelligently. Items to note:
 *
 *    - At the start of a job the planner should fill up with unplanned blocks before
 *      motion starts. This eliminates an initial move that plans to zero and ensures
 *      the planner gets a "head start" on managing the time in the planner queue.
 *
 *    - The planner should attempt to operate in OPTIMISTIC mode whenever possible, i.e.
 *      It should not plan the last block and assume that the next block will arrive in
 *      time and be a continuation of the movement. When this case is no longer true the
 *      planner switches to PESSIMISTIC mode where all blocks are planned, and the last
 *      block is always planned to zero (the tail). This handles the "last line" case
 *      of a legitimate tail.
 *
 *      Planning optimistically minimizes "overplanning" - i.e. moves planned multiple
 *      times (particularly tails). This requires leaving one unplanned move at the
 *      end (N) of the buffer, so the N-1 block always has a valid exit velocity to
 *      plan to (the entry velocity of the Nth block).
 *
 *	  - An intermediate CAUTIOUS mode is also required if there is insufficient time in
 *		the plan to decelerate from the target velocity to zero. Cautious mode limits the
 *		target velocity so that deceleration is always possible
 *
 *    - It's important to distinguish between the case where the new block is actually a
 *      startup condition and where it's the first block after a stop or a stall. The
 *      planner wants to perform a STARTUP in the first case, but start planning
 *      immediately in the latter cases.
 *
     - A hard case is where a long block is immediately followed by a very short block
 *      at the same velocity, with no more blocks behind them. In this case the first block
 *      will run and  lock, and the second block may have insufficient distance to get to zero.

/*
 *	CAUTIOUS PLANNING occurs when the time in the planner is insufficient to plan to zero
 *	from the target velocity (Vt). Vt must be limited so that a deceleration to zero is
 *	possible in the available time.
 *
 *	Terms
 *	  - Head - blocks are removed from the head of the planner queue - inserted in the tail
 *	  - Running block - the block that is currently running (at the head)
 *    - Ondeck block - the next block to run. If nothing is running it's the head block N,
 *                     otherwise it's the block behind the running (head) block, N+1
 *
 *  Factors influencing cautious mode include:
 *	  - Vtarget (Vt) - the requested velocity of a block
 *	  - Vrun (Vr)    - the velocity of the running block
 *    - Vondeck (Vo) - the velocity of the ondeck block
 *	  - To-plan      - time in the planner measured from the ondeck block
 *    - Trun         - time remaining in the runtime (estimated)
 *    - Ttimeout     - block timeout time - e.g. 30 ms
 *    - Treplan      - time required to replan the queue (worst case, e.g. 10 ms)
 *	  - T_-decel     - time required to decelerate from a velocity to zero (Vt, Vr, Vo)
 *    - L_-decel     - the distance (length) required to decelerate from Vt, Vr, Vo
 *
 *  Lemma1: The following equality must always be true: To-decel < (To-plan - Ttimeout - Treplan)
 *          This requires Vo to be limited so this is always true.
 *

/**** PLANNER BUFFER PRIMITIVES ************************************************************
 *
 *	Planner buffers are used to queue and operate on Gcode blocks. Each buffer contains
 *	one Gcode block which may be a move, an M code, or other command that must be
 *	executed synchronously with movement.
 *
 *	The planner queue (mb) is a circular queue of planner buffers (bf's). Each block has a
 *  pointer to the next block (nx), and one to the previous block (pv).
 *
 *  At the risk of being pedantic it's useful to get terms straight or it can get confusing.
 *
 *    - The "run" block is the block that is currently executing (i.e. in mr). Since
 *      it's a circular FIFO queue the running block is considered the "first block".
 *
 *    - The "write" block (aka "new" block) is the block that was just put on the queue.
 *      The new block is at the other end of the queue from the run block.
 *
 *    - Moving "forward" is advancing to the next block (nx), which is in the direction
 *      of the new block. Moving "backwards" backs up to the previous block (pv) in the
 *      direction of the running block. Since the queue is a doubly linked circular list
 *      the ends connect, and blocks "outside" of the running and new blocks may be empty.
 *
 *    - The "planning" block is the block currently pointed to by the planner. This
 *      starts out right next to the running block and advances towards the new block
 *      as planning executes. Planning executes predominantly in the forward direction.
 *
 *	New blocks are populated by (1) getting a write buffer, (2) populating the buffer,
 *	then (3) placing it in the queue (commit write buffer). If an exception occurs
 *	during step (2) you can unget the write buffer before queuing it, which returns
 *	it to the pool of available buffers. (NB: Unget is currently unused but left in.)
 *
 *	The RUN buffer may be retrieved once for simple commands, or multiple times for
 *  long-running commands such as moves that get called multiple times. The first
 *  retrieval (get run buffer) will return the new run buffer. Subsequent retrievals
 *  will return the same buffer until it's state changes to complete. When the command
 *  is complete the run buffer is returned to the pool by freeing it.
 *
 * Notes:
 *	The write buffer pointer only moves forward on mp_commit_write_buffer, and the
 *  run buffer pointer only moves forward on mp_free_run_buffer().
 *	Tests, gets and unget have no effect on the pointers.
 *
 * Functions Provided:
 * _clear_buffer(bf)        Zero the contents of a buffer
 *
 * mp_init_buffers()        Initialize or reset buffers
 *
 * mp_get_prev_buffer(bf)   Return pointer to the previous buffer in the linked list
 * mp_get_next_buffer(bf)   Return pointer to the next buffer in the linked list
 *
 * mp_get_write_buffer()    Get pointer to next available write buffer
 *                          Return pointer or NULL if no buffer available.
 *
 * mp_commit_write_buffer()	Commit the write buffer to the queue.
 *                          Advance write pointer & changes buffer state.
 *
 *                          *** WARNING *** The calling routine must NOT use the write
 *                          buffer once it has been committed as it may be processed
 *                          and freed (cleared) before the commit function returns.
 *
 * mp_get_run_buffer()      Get pointer to the next or current run buffer.
 *                          Return a new run buffer if prev buf was ENDed.
 *                          Return same buf if called again before ENDing.
 *                          Return NULL if no buffer available.
 *                          This behavior supports continuations (iteration).
 *
 * mp_free_run_buffer()     Release the run buffer & return to buffer pool.
 *                          Return true if queue is empty, false otherwise.
 *                          This is useful for doing queue empty / end move functions.
 * *
 * UNUSED BUT PROVIDED FOR REFERENCE:
 * mp_unget_write_buffer()  Free write buffer if you decide not to commit it.
 * mp_copy_buffer(bf,bp)	Copy the contents of bp into bf - preserves links.
