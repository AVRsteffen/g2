 **** Feedholds ********************************************************************

/*
 *  Feedholds, queue flushes and end_holds are all related and are in this file.
 *  Feedholds are implemented as a state machine (cmFeedholdState) that runs in the 
 *  planner (plan_exec.cpp, see Feedhold Processing around line 500) and in this file.
 *
 *  Feedholds also use the dual planner (secondary context, or hold context) where a
 *  new canonical machine and planner are spun up and entered when a feedhold is initiated. 
 *  This allows (almost) all of the machine operations to be accessible during a feedhold.
 *
 *  Feedholds are initiated and ended by a series of request flags (requests).
 *  The request functions set flags or change state to "REQUESTED". 
 *  The sequencing callback interprets the flags as so:
 *    - A feedhold request received during motion should be honored
 *    - A feedhold request received during a feedhold should be ignored
 *    - A feedhold request received during a motion stop should be ignored
 *
 *    - A queue flush request should only be honored while in a feedhold
 *    - Said queue flush request received during a feedhold should be deferred until
 *      the feedhold enters a HOLD state (i.e. until deceleration is complete and motors stop).
 *    - A queue flush request received during a motion stop should be honored
 *
 *    - An end_hold (cycle start) request should only be honored while in a feedhold
 *    - Said end_hold request received during a feedhold should be deferred until the
 *      feedhold enters a HOLD state (i.e. until deceleration is complete).
 *      If a queue flush request is also present the queue flush should be done first
 */
/*  Below the request level, feedholds work like this:
 *    - The hold is initiated by calling cm_start_hold(). cm->hold_state is set to
 *      FEEDHOLD_SYNC, motion_state is set to MOTION_HOLD, and the spindle is turned off
 *      (if it it on). The remainder of feedhold
 *      processing occurs in plan_exec.c in the mp_exec_aline() function.
 *
 *      - MOTION_HOLD and FEEDHOLD_SYNC tells mp_exec_aline() to begin feedhold processing
 *      after the current move segment is finished (< 5 ms later). (Cases handled by
 *      feedhold processing are listed in plan_exec.c).
 *
 *    - FEEDHOLD_SYNC causes the current move in mr to be replanned into a deceleration.
 *      If the distance remaining in the executing move is sufficient for a full deceleration
 *      then motion will stop in the current block. Otherwise the deceleration phase
 *      will extend across as many blocks necessary until one will stop.
 *
 *    - Once deceleration is complete hold state transitions to FEEDHOLD_FINALIZING and 
 *      the distance remaining in the bf last block is replanned up from zero velocity.
 *      The move in the bf block is NOT released (unlike normal operation), as it will
 *      be used again to restart from hold.
 *
 *    - When cm_end_hold() is called it releases the hold, restarts the move and restarts
 *      the spindle if the spindle is active.
 */

/* With the addition of the secondary CM, feedhold state management gets tricky.
   What you see below is a temporary solution until we decide the general solution.
   
   The general solution causes a feedhold from the primary context to switch 
   into the secondary context to perform feedhold actions. When in the secondary
   context an additional feedhold will perform the usual STOP operation, but 
   will remain in the secondary context, and therefore not perform any feedhold
   actions (lifts, spindle, etc.). This is needed to support homing and probing 
   operations from within the secondary context.
   
   Oddities of the general solution:
      - Should we allow a feedhold to be performed if the tool is not moving? 
        Right now we don't, but with the secondary context this might be useful
   
    What you see here is a Q&D to only allow feedholds from the primary context. 
    It has the following limitations:
      - Feedhold requests are only honored form the primary context
      - Queue flush requests are only honored form the primary context
      - Machine alarm state is not (yet) taken into account in feedhold sequencing and restart

 * Queue Flush operations
 *
 * This one's complicated. See here first:
 * https://github.com/synthetos/g2/wiki/Job-Exception-Handling
 * https://github.com/synthetos/g2/wiki/Alarm-Processing
 *
 * We want to use queue flush for a few different use cases, as per the above wiki pages.
 * The % behavior implements Exception Handling cases 1 and 2 - Stop a Single Move and
 * Stop Multiple Moves. This is complicated further by the processing in single USB and
 * dual USB being different. Also, the state handling is located in xio.cpp / readline(),
 * controller.cpp _dispatch_kernel() and cm_request_queue_flush(), below.
 * So it's documented here.
 *
 * Single or Dual USB Channels:
 *  - If a % is received outside of a feed hold or ALARM state, ignore it.
 *      Change the % to a ; comment symbol (xio)
 *
 * Single USB Channel Operation:
 *  - Enter a feedhold (!)
 *  - Receive a queue flush (%) Both dispatch it and store a marker (ACK) in the input
 *      buffer in place of the the % (xio)
 *  - Execute the feedhold to a hold condition (plan_exec)
 *  - Execute the dispatched % to flush queues (canonical_machine)
 *  - Silently reject any commands up to the % in the input queue (controller)
 *  - When ETX is encountered transition to STOP state (controller/canonical_machine)
 *
 * Dual USB Channel Operation:
 *  - Same as above except that we expect the % to arrive on the control channel
 *  - The system will read and dump all commands in the data channel until either a
 *    clear is encountered ({clear:n} or $clear), or an ETX is encountered on either
 *    channel, but it really should be on the data channel to ensure all queued commands
 *    are dumped. It is the host's responsibility to both write the clear (or ETX), and
 *    to ensure that it either arrives on the data channel or that the data channel is
 *    empty before writing it to the control channel.
